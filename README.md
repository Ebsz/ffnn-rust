# FFNN-Rust
Rust implementation of a fully-connected neural network that learns to recognize handwritten images from the MNIST dataset.

The project was written in order to get familiar with working with neural nets in Rust. As such, it has little practical value, but might be useful for anyone on a similar journey :)


# Usage
The program expects to find an `mnist` directory in the project root containing the unzipped [training-dataset.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

With that in place, compile and run with `cargo run`
